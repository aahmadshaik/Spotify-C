# Spotify Clone

This project is a Spotify clone created using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Spotify API, and Axios. It was developed as part of the master class at OMNIVERSITY.

## Project Highlights

- **Tailwind CSS & Material UI**: Enhanced the visual appeal and user experience.
- **Spotify API**: Integrated to fetch real-time data, providing an authentic Spotify experience.
- **Axios**: Managed API requests efficiently to handle data.

## Key Features

- **Search and Play Songs**: Users can search for their favorite tracks and play them directly.
- **Playlist Management**: Create, update, and manage custom playlists.
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time updates and display of song metadata and album art.
- **App Download**: Feature to download the app.
- **Play/Pause, Next/Previous**: Full control over playback.
